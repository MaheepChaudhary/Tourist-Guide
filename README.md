# Tourist-Guide
This model is inspired by the problem of SIH 2020 i.e. Virtual Tourist Guide. The whole problem is that a user can take a picture of a monument and the information will come automatically about that monument on the page of tripadvisor.com. I extracted the pictures using Selenium and manipulated them using OpenCV by making them of gray colour, flipping them 180 and also did both when dor some monuments the trained my model for three monuments due to lack of time and availability of arrranged data. The monumets taken are Eiffel Tower, Taj Mahal and Statue of Liberty. I trained my model on Convolutional Neural Network to obtain optimum performance by taking dataset of approximate 1000 images per monument. I would like to thank tripadvisor.com to make model complete.
